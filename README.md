# Obsidian Image Slider
This plugin helps you make an image slider in obsidian notes.

You can do it for both local and cloud images too.

For local images, you can use it as follows:

```
```image-slider-8
![[Pasted image 20231103120023.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231103120114.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231103120044.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231103170316.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231103120114.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231104163420.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231104163429.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231104163453.png]]
```

For images from the internet, you can use it as follows:

```
```image-slider-5
![](https://picsum.photos/id/1/200/300)
![](https://picsum.photos/id/2/200/300)
![](https://picsum.photos/id/3/200/300)
![](https://picsum.photos/id/4/200/300)
![](https://picsum.photos/id/5/200/300)

```


The number '5' means it can show 5 images. You can put 20 images in each code-block. 

	'1': 1,
	'2': 2,
	'3': 3,
	'4': 4,
	'5': 5,
	'6': 6,
	'7': 7,
	'8': 8,
	'9': 9,
	'10': 10,
	'11': 11,
	'12': 12,
	'13': 13,
	'14': 14,
	'15': 15,
	'16': 16,
	'17': 17,
	'18': 18,
	'19': 19,
	'20': 20

## Roadmap:

- Using next and previous button to navigate in between the images
- Using dot like slide-controllers for jumping to exact images you're looking for.
- Image captions
- Overlay text on images

This plugin is heavily inspired by obsidian-image-layouts plugin.
