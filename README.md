# Obsidian Image Slider
This plugin helps you make an image slider in obsidian notes. Currently, the slides can only be swiped using touchpad of the device.


# Usuage

It can be used for both local as well as for cloud images. For local images, you can use it as follows:

```
```image-slider-8
![[Pasted image 20231103120023.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231103120114.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231103120044.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231103170316.png]]

```

For images from the internet, you can use it as follows:

```
```image-slider-5
![](https://picsum.photos/id/1/200/300)
![](https://picsum.photos/id/2/200/300)
![](https://picsum.photos/id/3/200/300)
![](https://picsum.photos/id/4/200/300)
![](https://picsum.photos/id/5/200/300)

```


The number '5' means it can show 5 images. You can put 20 images in each code-block. 

	'1': 1,
	'2': 2,
	'3': 3,
	'4': 4,
	'5': 5,
	'6': 6,
	'7': 7,
	'8': 8,
	'9': 9,
	'10': 10,
	'11': 11,
	'12': 12,
	'13': 13,
	'14': 14,
	'15': 15,
	'16': 16,
	'17': 17,
	'18': 18,
	'19': 19,
	'20': 20

## Roadmap:

- Using next and previous button to navigate in between the images
- Using dot like slide-controllers for jumping to exact images you're looking for.
- Image captions
- Overlay text on images

This plugin is heavily inspired by obsidian-image-layouts plugin.
