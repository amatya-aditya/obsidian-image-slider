You can do it for both local as well as cloud images too.

Here, the letter 'h' means it can hold 8 images. The letter is assigned to the number of images it support. For now, it is limited to 12 images. 

	'a': 1,
	'b': 2,
	'c': 3,
	'd': 4,
	'e': 5,
	'f': 6,
	'g': 7,
	'h': 8,
	'i': 9,
	'j': 10,
	'k': 11,
	'l': 12

## Roadmap:

- Using next and previous button to navigate in between the images
- Using dot like slide-controllers for jumping to exact images you're looking for.
- Image captions
- Overlay text on images

This plugin is heavily inspired by obsidian-image-layouts plugin.
